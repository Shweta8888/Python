    "The mean value, or some other measure of the center of a distribution, is often the first thing one looks for in a data set, or a subsample of a data set.  For example, in a long time series of surface temperature, one might want to know the mean value for each year, together with some idea of how much each mean might vary from its \"true\" value in an ensemble of worlds.  Here the difficulty of the frequentist interpretation is evident--we only have one world.  We can have many realizations of a numerical model of that world, though, so at least via numerical experiments it is possible to generate an ensemble of time series that are different because of some random variations in initial conditions and/or forcing.\n",

    "Let's start exploring these ideas with the simplest possible case, however: random numbers generated from a known distribution, not necessarily a Gaussian.  The experimental approach illustrated here, in which we calculate statistics from a generated ensemble, is complementary to the theoretical approach, in which analytic expressions are calculated for PDFs of interest.  The advantages of the experimental approach are that (1) it doesn't require mathematical sophistication, (2) it can be applied to situations for which the analytic approach would be very difficult or even impossible, (3) it is relatively easy to understand and visualize."
