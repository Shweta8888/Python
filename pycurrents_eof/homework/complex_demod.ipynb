    "The concepts of modulation and demodulation arise naturally in the context of transmitting information via radio.  There are two basic kinds of modulation used to transmit audio via radio frequency signals: amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).  In both cases the fundamental radio frequency of the signal is the \"carrier frequency\", which would be a perfect sinusoid in the case of no modulation (no audio signal).  For AM, the carrier is multiplied by the signal in the audio frequency band (20 Hz to 20 kHz).  For FM, the *frequency* of the carrier is shifted up and down with the audio signal waveform.  In either case, the job of the receiver is to isolate the modulated signal from all the other radio-frequency energy, and extract the original audio signal from it--which is called \"demodulation\", of course.  The way this is done in an AM receiver is essentially identical to the data analysis technique called \"complex demodulation\", where the \"complex\" has nothing to do with complexity.  It is merely a reference to the use of complex exponentials, which makes the mathematical description and the programming code more concise.  The technique is really very simple, and can be implemented with or without the use of complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ multiply your time series by a complex exponential at the frequency of interest\n",
    "+ apply a low-pass filter to the product\n",
    "+ look at the amplitude and phase of the resulting complex time series\n",
    "\n",
    "As this recipe indicates, the purpose of complex demodulation is to isolate a fairly narrow frequency band and describe it as a sinusoid that can be modulated in amplitude (which we see in the amplitude part of the complex demodulation output) and in frequency (which we see in the rate of change of phase with time).  For example, it can be used to isolate the spring-neap cycle of the semidiurnal tide--an example of amplitude modulation resulting from the superposition of the M2 and S2 tidal constituents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the mathematical version of the recipe.  Recall that the time series can be represented as a sum of sinusoids via its Fourier Transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t_n) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} A_k \\exp(i 2 \\pi f_k t_n).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t_n) \\exp(-i 2 \\pi f t_n) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} A_k \\exp(i 2 \\pi (f_k-f) t_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that each component at $f_k$ has been shifted down to frequency $f_k - f$.  For example, if $f_k$ and $f$ are both 1 cycle per year, then the energy at 1 cycle per year is shifted to zero-frequency--that is, it is appears in the mean.  Using a low-pass filter will isolate the energy that is near frequency $f$.  The amplitude of the low-passed complex product will vary slowly with time, as the amplitude of the energy near $f$ varies.  The phase will vary slowly in time, depending on how the frequency content of that energy compares to $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall a central concept from Fourier analysis: the uncertainty principle stating that there is always a tradeoff between localization in time and localization in frequency.  A narrow bandwidth signal has a modulation with a large time scale, and a pulse-like signal has a broad bandwidth.  This concept applies to complex demodulation (and to its relative, wavelet analysis).  It is just as inescapable as the uncertainty principle in quantum physics."
