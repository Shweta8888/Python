Notes for running diagnostics for the LE experiments:

The examples in this directory are configured for the following settings:

Model - b.e11.BRCP85C5CNBDRD.f09_g16.002 years 2056-2080
Control - b.e11.B20TRC5CNBDRD.f09_g16.002 years 2081-2005

The env_*.xml files contain the settings that were used to generate the 
diagnostics plots. 

---------

1. Prep'ing the input files

Some of the variable time series files are on glade in
   /glade/p/cesmLE/CESM-CAM5-BGC-LE 
but the files are separated out into variable subdirs. The postprocessing tools
expect all the variable time-series files to be in one directory. So, you need to edit
and run the $POSTPROCESS_PATH/Tools/gather_var_files.py in order to 
create symbolic links.

----------

2. Variable time-series files year ranges

The variable time-series files were split along year boundaries. For example:

b.e11.BRCP85C5CNBDRD.f09_g16.002.pop.h.QSW_HBL.200601-210012.nc
b.e11.BRCP85C5CNBDRD.f09_g16.002.pop.h.QSW_HBL.208101-210012.nc

This can be a problem for the averager if the diagnostics years requested 
spans the break. You will need to concatenate the files into one long 
file using nccat or generate averages and diagnostics for years that
are inclusive to the existing ranges. 

----------

3. Download some missing variable files from HPSS for ocean diagnostics. 

Because of space constraints on glade, only key variable files were kept on disk. 
However, all the variable time series files are on HPSS. The ocean diagnostics
require 6 missing variable files that includes KAPPA_THIC, KAPPA_ISOP, SV,
UISOP, VISOP, and WISOP. These variable files need to be downloaded prior to
running the postprocessing tools. Here is a helper script to download
these files in this examples directory:

get_LE_ocn_files.py
files_to_get_model.txt
files_to_get_control.txt

Edit the get_LE_ocn_files.csh to update the paths appropriately then
run using:
./get_LE_ocn_files.py
